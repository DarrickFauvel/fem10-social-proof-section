## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Superfast bundling tool

### What I learned

I learned to use flexbox and grid gaps more, instead of using margins to space elements.

### Continued development

There is an issue with the bottom background image appearing clipped when scrolling the page.
